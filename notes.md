HashMaps (url: https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/)
Hashrtable is a data structure that maps keys to values. 
Hash Map uses a hash table for implmentation while treemaps uses a binary search tree. 
In arrays, the data is referenced using a numberic index (relatively to the postiion). 
However, HashMaps uses labels that could be a string, number, ojbect, or anything. 
Internally, the HashMap uses an Array, and it maps the labels to array indexes using a hash function. 
Two ways to implement hashmaps: 
- Array : using a hash function to map a key to the array index value. 
Worst:O(n) Average:O(1)
- Binary Search Tree: Using a self-balancing binary search tree lookup for values. 
Worst: O(log n) Average: O(log n)

The most common implementation of Maps is using an array and hash function.
